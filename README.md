# GPT-4 Command Executor

GPT-4 Command Executor is a Python application that uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate terminal commands based on user input and execute them locally on the user's computer.

## ⚠️ Warning

Executing commands generated by an AI model may lead to unexpected results and security risks. Always review and approve the commands before allowing them to execute.

## Features

- Interact with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate terminal commands
- Execute commands locally using the Python `subprocess` library
- Store API keys securely using environment variables and `python-dotenv`

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An OpenAI API key (register at https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Change to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies using `make install`
4. Set up the '.env' file
5. Install the project as a Python package using `pip install -e .`

## Usage
To use the GPT-4 Command Executor in your Python code, simply import the get_terminal_command and execute_command functions from the gpt4_command_executor package:

```python
from gpt4_command_executor import get_terminal_command, execute_command
```

## Example

Here's a simple script that uses the GPT-4 Command Executor to request a terminal command based on user input and execute it on the local computer. The script prompts the user for input and generates a potential terminal command based on that input.

Assuming you have installed the project as a Python package (as described in the Installation section), you can create a script like this:

```python
from gpt4_command_executor import get_terminal_command, execute_command

def main():
    print("Welcome to GPT-4 Command Executor!")
    
    while True:
        prompt = input("Enter your command request (or type 'exit' to quit): ")
        
        if prompt.lower() == "exit":
            break

        # Get a command suggestion from GPT-4
        command = get_terminal_command(prompt)
        
        print(f"Generated command: {command}")

        # Execute the command (optionally: add a confirmation before execution)
        result = execute_command(command)
        
        print(f"Command output:\n{result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

It's saved locally as as gpt4_command_executor_demo.py in the main project directory or any other location.

Run the script in the terminal using the command:

```python gpt4_command_executor_demo.py```

The script will prompt you for a command request, and then use GPT-4 to generate and execute a potential terminal command based on your input.

Please ensure you understand and accept all potential risks associated with executing AI-generated commands. Always review and approve the commands before executing them to avoid unintended results or security-related issues.

Here's an example of the script in action:
