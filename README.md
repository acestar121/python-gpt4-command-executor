# GPT-4 Command Executor

GPT-4 Command Executor is a Python application that uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate terminal commands based on user input and execute them locally on the user's computer.

## ⚠️ Warning

Executing commands generated by an AI model may lead to unexpected results and security risks. Always review and approve the commands before allowing them to execute.

## Features

- Interact with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate terminal commands
- Execute commands locally using the Python `subprocess` library
- Store API keys securely using environment variables and `python-dotenv`

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- An OpenAI API key (register at https://beta.openai.com/signup/)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Change to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies using `make install`
4. Set up the '.env' file
5. Install the project as a Python package using `pip install -e .`
6. chmod +x copilot_cli
7. Run the script using `./copilot_cli`
8. Check out examples below
9. Enjoy!

## Example

The script will prompt you for a command request, and then use GPT-4 to generate and execute a potential terminal command based on your input.

Please ensure you understand and accept all potential risks associated with executing AI-generated commands. Always review and approve the commands before executing them to avoid unintended results or security-related issues.

Here's an example of the script in action:

```
    ~  q '?? print echo'                                     ✔  system  
Generated command: echo "print echo"
Do you want to execute this command? (y/n): n
Sorry, I couldn't generate a command for that request.
```

```
    ~  q '?? remove whole system'                            ✔  system  
Generated command 'rm -rf /*' is not safe. Skipping execution.
Sorry, I couldn't generate a command for that request.
```

```
    ~  q '?? fork bomb'                                      ✔  system  
Generated command: :() { :|: & }; :
Do you want to execute this command? (y/n): 
```
